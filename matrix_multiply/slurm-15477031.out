[[2191,1],1]: A high-performance Open MPI point-to-point messaging module
was unable to find any relevant network interfaces:

Module: OpenFabrics (openib)
  Host: smp-9-5

Another transport will be used instead, although this may result in
lower performance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
WARNING: No preset parameters were found for the device that Open MPI
detected:

  Local host:            smp-7-4
  Device name:           qedr0
  Device vendor ID:      0x1077
  Device vendor part ID: 32880

Default device parameters will be used, which may result in lower
performance.  You can edit any of the files specified by the
btl_openib_device_param_files MCA parameter to set values for your
device.

NOTE: You can turn off this warning by setting the MCA parameter
      btl_openib_warn_no_device_params_found to 0.
